# Countdown-List

*The app is available for download in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=aus10.firstApp.countdownList).*

### Overview
This Android application uses an SQLite database to store a list of events and timers counting down until the date and time of the event. Events are input by the user and stored into the database. On opening the app, it will read in everything from the database and fill an ArrayList with the items. The items in the ArrayList are put into a layout inflater that adapts the items into a ListView. This application was developed in Android Studios.
